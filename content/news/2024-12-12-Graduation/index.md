I am thrilled to share that I have successfully completed my Ph.D. at the University of Sydney (USYD)! This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, filled with invaluable learning experiences and academic growth.

I want to extend my gratitude to my supervisor Mohsen Ramezani, parents, friends, colleagues, and everyone who has supported me along the way. Looking forward to the next chapter and new opportunities ahead!
